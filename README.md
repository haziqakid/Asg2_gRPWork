Website name: Weather How?

Have you ever wondered how the weather might be in an hour or a day's time? Don't worry, our user-friendly weather app can show you the weather for now, the following hour, and anything else you might need.

It's free, accurate, and uncluttered.

Anyone who wants to find out more about the weather can utilize this website. This service is primarily used by people who are planning vacations and want to check the weather in a new country. It's also used by people who want to have a good time outside.

 
## Design Process
 
This website is designed for drivers, delivery drivers, and riders, as well as those organising outdoor meetings or events. 

Before starting to design the website, I went to a lot of websites to see and feel whether they were simple to understand, read, and use from a user's perspective. then write a list of the issues I encountered and aim not to repeat them. As stated previously, this website is primarily designed for motorists who want to plan ahead for their upcoming trip, as well as individual who need to take outdoor photoshoots.

The "logo" for the website may be seen on the top left of the website's most top page. The logo has not yet been finalized. The navigation is located in the top right corner of the website for simple access and navigating.
